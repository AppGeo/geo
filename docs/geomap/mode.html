      <p>The mode property determines how the map responds to user interaction and which events the developer receives.</p>
      
      <p>There is currently only one mode.</p>
      <!--<h2>static</h2>
      <h3>user experience</h3>
      <p>The map widget displays tiles and map images as normal but the user cannot interact with them, e.g., the user can't pan or zoom.</p>
      <h3>events</h3>
      <p>All regular browser events bubble up to parent controls and eventually the document. No widget-specific events trigger.</p>-->
      <h2>pan</h2>
      <h3>user experience</h3>
      <p>The default cursor is an open hand in browsers that support data URIs and a four point arrow otherwise.</p>

      <p>The user can drag the map to pan. The map will continue panning a little after the user lets go. They can zoom in or out with the scroll wheel. They can also double-click or double-tap to zoom in one level.</p>
      <h3>events</h3>
      <p>In pan mode, the geomap widget triggers the following events on the original map div.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>move &ndash; when the user moves the mouse above the map but is not actively panning</li>
        <li>click &ndash; when the user clicks or taps a point on the map without initiating a pan, i.e., they let go of the map at the same point and within a short time threshold</li>
        <li>dblclick &ndash; when the user double-clicks or double-taps a point on the map without initiating a pan</li>
        <li>bboxchange &ndash; when the user changes the bbox by panning or zooming</li>
      </ul>

      <!--<h2>zoom</h2>

      <h3>user experience</h3>
      <p>The default cursor is a crosshair.</p>

      <p>In this mode the user can perform a marquee zoom by clicking and holding one point and dragging the mouse cursor. A box will form. When the user lets go of the mouse, the map will zoom to the closest approximation of the bbox of the drawn shape.</p>
      <p>Dynamic services are only limited by the ratio between the size of the drawn shape and the map div's current size. Cached services are limited to those as well but also specific map zoom levels so the final bbox will not be as close.</p>
      <p>The user can also zoom in or out with the scroll wheel as well as double-click or double-tap to center on a location and zoom in one level.</p>
      <p>This is not a very useful mode for mobile applications (only double-tap is possible) but provides a more exact method of zooming into an area for desktop users who want it.</p>

      <h3>events</h3>
      <p>In zoom mode the geomap widget triggers the following events on the original map div.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>geomapmove when the user moves the mouse above the map but is not actively performing a marquee zoom</li>
        <li>geomapbbox when the user changes the bbox by zooming</li>
        <li>geomapclick when the user clicks or taps a point on the map without initiating a zoom, i.e., they let go of the map at the same point and within a short time threshold</li>
