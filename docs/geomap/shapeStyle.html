      <p>The shapeStyle method retrieves or updates the <i>default</i> style of geomap graphics. The reasons that this is a method instead of a property will be clearer in a future release.</p>
      <p>This method changes specific properties of the internal default style. If you send an incomplete style object, only the style properties you reference are updated.</p>
      <p>You can override this style with every call to addShape.</p>
      <p>Changing this default style will update the style of any existing shape that has been added with addShape but not given its own style. For example, if you add two GeoJSON Point objects and in the first addShape call you do not pass a style but in the second one you do. In this situation, future calls to shapeStyle will only update how geomap draws the first shape.</p>
      <p>When called with a second argument to set the shapeStyle, this method returns the original jQuery collection to maintain call chaining.</p>
      <h2>geomap style</h2>
      <p>A geomap style is an object whose properties follow a subset of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html">SVG styling</a> properties. The specific styles that geomap recognizes and to which geometry they apply are listed below.</p>

      <p>All properties apply to Point shapes which means that you can adjust the stroke and fill of the oval surrounding the point location.</p>
