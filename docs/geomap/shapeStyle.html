      <p>The shapeStyle method retrieves or updates the <i>base</i> style of geomap graphics. The reasons that this is a method instead of a property will be clearer in a future section of the internals documenation.</p>
      <p>This method changes specific properties of the internal base style. If you send an incomplete style object, only the style properties you reference are updated.</p>
      <p>Similar to CSS, you can override this style on a per-shape basis by passing a different style to the append method.</p>
      <p>Changing this base style will update how geomap draws existing shapes that do not have their own style. For shapes that do have their own style, changing the base shapeStyle will update any style properties not referenced in the shape-specific style. For example, assume the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>the base shapeStyle has a red stroke color and strokeWidth of 2px</li>
        <li>you call append with a style that increases the stroke width to 4px but leaves the stroke color red</li>
        <li>you later change the base shapeStyle's stroke color to blue</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The shape described in the above example will draw with a blue stroke color and a strokeWidth of 4px.</p>
      <p>When called with a second argument to set the shapeStyle, the jQuery UI widget factory returns the original jQuery collection to maintain call chaining.</p>
      <h2>geomap style</h2>
      <p>A geomap style is an object whose properties follow a subset of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html">SVG styling</a> properties. The specific styles that geomap recognizes and to which geometry they apply are listed below.</p>
