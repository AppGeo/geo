      <p>We keep some plugin design decisions here.</p>
      <h2>jQuery UI widget factory</h2>
      <p>The geomap widget uses the same widget factory that all other jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile widgets use. Like jQuery Mobile, we include a copy of jquery.ui.widget.js in the project. While this adds 3k to the final compressed build it allows us to easilly follow the patterns designed by UI and better integrate into the jQuery plugin community.</p>
      <pre><code>$.widget( "geo.geomap", { } );</code></pre>
      <h2>Virtual state</h2>
      <p>The public properties bbox, bboxMax and center do not always match the internal state of the map widget. In fact internally, geomap only tracks center and pixelSize. The bbox and bboxMax properties are calculated based on the current or max center and pixelSize. In the code, you will see two properties each for each of these. One is public, the other is private. For center, the internal position (_center) is always in internal map units (web mercator meters by default) even if $.geo.proj is not null and the developer sets the public center by longitude &amp; latitude.</p>
      <h2>Initialization options</h2>
      <p>You may notice that we override jQuery UI's _createWidget function in order to capture the options passed in by the user. <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanttb">Let us know</a> if there's a better way to do that. At the end of _create, we iterate over the passed options and set certain internal state values before creating services and refreshing the map. This insures that we handle supplied bbox or center properly. Since bbox and center can potentially conflict, only supply one. If both are supplied the behavior is technically undefined but currently center will override bbox.</p>
      <h2>External libraries</h2>
      <p>Apart from the jQuery UI widget factory, geomap includes a couple external libraries.</p>
      <h3>Mouse wheel extension 3.0.2</h3>
      <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/node/7146">http://plugins.jquery.com/node/7146</a>
      <p>We've found this to be a very stable mousewheel special event plugin and are using it to handle mouse wheel interaction. This plugin's license comment and source are included intact in the minified releases of $.geo.</p>
      <h2>Service types</h2>
      <p>Developers can set the services array used by the geomap widget. When it comes time to draw map images, the geomap widget uses an internal _serviceTypes object. The object contains one property for each service type geomap supports, e.g., tiled and shingled. The type property on each service object determines which serviceType object geomap uses to refresh the service. The following code snippet is a simplification of the relationship.</p>
      <pre><code>options: {
  services: [
    {
      id: 'OSM',
      type: 'tiled' /* ... */
    }
  ]
},

_serviceTypes: {
  tiled: {
    refresh: function (map, service) {
    },
  }
}</code></pre>
      <p>In the future the _serviceTypes property will be public and developers can extend the service types geomap supports.</p>
